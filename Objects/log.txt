The total size of your local CSS and JS files is 1.8MB and another 0.0MB in other assets.
It is very important to only load the JS and CSS files from components that you actually use in your website/webapp!
 

If you are using public frameworks (like jQuery, Bootstrap, etc...), consider using their CDN so the browser can use already buffered versions.
Done!
